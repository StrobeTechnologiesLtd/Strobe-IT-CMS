high on the West facing slope of the Blackdown hills, Blackborough offers panoramic views, miles of woodland tracks and a thriving community. The Blackdown hills are themselves a designated area of outstanding natural beauty. This small village hosts a surprising variety of clubs, activities and social events, many of which have become much anticipated annual traditions which all ages enjoy.&nbsp;At the foot of the hill lies the village of Kentisbeare with its post office stores, thriving primary school, pub and pretty village square from where the school bus ferries children to and from the highly regarded Uffculme School. A more extensive range of facilities is to found in Cullompton (about 5 miles) and where the M5 facilitates rapid commuting south to the Cathedral City of Exeter and north to the county town of Taunton. The comparatively central mid devon location places the picturesque National Parks of Dartmoor and Exmoor together with north and south Devon coastlines all within a modest car journey.&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the ground floor</p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">UPVc half glazed door to </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Conservatory/Garden Room</span><span lang="en-GB"> with one wall of masonry construction and one with lower walling, two sides being picture windows enjoying astonishing far reaching views across the Culm Valley and distant Devon countryside towards Dartmoor, twin French doors to patio, radiator, ceramic tiled floor, part glazed inner door to</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Kitchen/Breakfast Room</span><span lang="en-GB"> with lovely stone tiled floor and range of white fronted units comprising eight base cupboards, drawer pack, integrated fridge, work tops with inset stainless steel one and a half bowl single drainer sink, mixer tap, inset Bosch four ring halogen hob with double oven/grill beneath, lovely stone tiled splashbacks, six wall cupboards, shelved unit with willow basket storage, downlighting, boiler cupboard housing Grant oil fired boiler for hot water and central heating, radiator, dual aspect, ceiling beam.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Sitting Room</span><span lang="en-GB"> extending the full width of the cottage having two windows again enjoying spectacular far reaching outlook, beamed ceiling, radiator, fireplace with beam and slate hearth housing multi fuel stove with adjoining log storage, downlighting.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Utility Room</span><span lang="en-GB"> with continuation of stone tiled floor from kitchen, double base unit with L-shaped work top over, space and plumbing for washing machine, three wall cupboards, radiator, ceiling beam, space for fridge/freezer.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Bathroom 2</span><span lang="en-GB"> refitted with modern P-shaped bath having shower over, shower curtain and rail, extractor, fabulous stone sink with mixer tap and cupboard beneath, close coupled corner WC, stone tiled walls and travertine work top, travertine floor, window, downlighting, chrome ladder style towel rail/radiator.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">On the first floor</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">The concealed cottage staircase leads from the sitting room to the L-shaped landing, lit by flank window, radiator, boarded loft with retractable ladder and light, exposed cruck beam.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Bedroom 1</span><span lang="en-GB"> radiator, exposed cruck beams, two windows again with magnificent country views.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Bedroom 2</span><span lang="en-GB"> radiator, garden outlook, downlighting.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Bedroom 3</span><span lang="en-GB"> fitted linen cupboard and adjoining double wardrobe with hanging rail and shelving, fitted computer desk with shelving, garden outlook, downlighting.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Bathroom 1 </span><span lang="en-GB">short bath with mains shower over, shower curtain and rail, travertine tiled surround, close coupled WC, vitreous enamel washbasin with cupboard beneath, chrome ladder style towel rail/radiator, extractor, window over looking garden.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Outside</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang="en-GB">Timber gate with stone steps leading to front door.&nbsp; The gardens lie mainly to the side with large river stone paved patio adjoining the conservatory ideal for alfresco entertaining, extensive lawn flanked by established shrub borders and laurel hedging beyond.&nbsp; Useful garden store accessible from both garden and conservatory.&nbsp; Grassy bank having stone steps rising up to rear gate providing direct access to country paths leading through the adjoining Blackborough woods.&nbsp; A single </span><span lang="en-GB">Garage</span><span lang="en-GB"> with up and over door is to be found on the other side of the lane.</span></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2593, NULL, NULL, '0000-00-00', 'N', 'N', '', 'N', 'N', 'N', '', '', '', ''),

roof, improvements have included the installation of double glazed windows and gas fired central heating.&nbsp; The remarkably spacious accommodation is attractively arranged over three floors with the dining room and sitting room being linked by a wide archway.&nbsp; The kitchen with its hand painted units and utility room lie to the rear.&nbsp; The ground floor bathroom has the advantage of providing a ground floor toilet whilst at the same time allowing all three bedrooms to be generous doubles.&nbsp; An early inspection is strongly recommended to those seeking a characterful home with far more accommodation than would normally be found in a more expensive modern property.&nbsp; The owner is moving abroad and much of the furniture and fitments are available by negotiation.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><!--[if !mso]>\r\n<style>\r\nv\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);}\r\no\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);}\r\nb\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);}\r\n.shape

(13, 1, 1, 'About Us', 'aboutus', '<h2>THE HISTORY OF THORNE AND CARTER</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The story of Thorne and Carter unfolds across three centuries of estate agency, auctioneering and surveying in the Culm Valley.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The practice was originally founded in the mid 1800s in Willand by William Thorne. When he retired towards the end of the century his son, Bill Thorne, was too young to take over the practice and so there was a gap of some years until Bill Thorne restarted the firm, again in Willand in 1911.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1930s Bill Thorne relocated the practice to the larger town of Cullompton and on his retirement in 1950 the practice was acquired by the late Ken Carter and had by then moved offices to Church Street.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The changing face of estate agency later necessitated the move to 29 High Street, a large three storey Victorian property. Ken Carter in partnership with his son Stephen ran a thriving multi disciplined chartered surveyors practice specialising in residential sales, surveys, farm sales and associated agricultural work, with the firm even having its own livestock market based at Tiverton Junction in Willand.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of 1988 Ken Carter retired and his son Stephen formed a new partnership with Clive Madge, who had been specialising in the agricultural and professional side of the practice, together with John Parkin who had been handling the residential sales.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the 1990s steady growth in the residential sales resulted in increased staff and emphasised the need for even larger premises in a more prominent and central High Street position. With this in mind the partners acquired 11 &amp; 13 High Street fondly known locally as the &ldquo;Old Police Station&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">During much of the autumn of 1999 the premises underwent a complete refurbishment and remodelling including the former &ldquo;cells&rdquo; being integrated into the company&rsquo;s boardroom.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Following his retirement from the partnership Stephen Carter continued as a consultant for several years before retiring fully.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">John and Clive continue in partnership with their long standing experienced team in both the residential and professional departments.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A nostalgic inspection of the archives reveals that the first property sold under the Thorne and Carter partnership was near Taunton in February 1951 selling for &pound;3,500 and earned the company the princely sum of &pound;29 in commission! Interestingly the same property sold in 2012 for &pound;320,000. This at the time when a gallon of petrol cost 3 shillings 6 pence (17&frac12;p), a loaf of bread was 6 pence (2&frac12;p) and a brand new Morris Minor car would set you back &pound;520 whilst the internet was not even a distant dream!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>The Partners</h2>\r\n<h4>Clive Madge &nbsp; BSc MRICS FAAV</h4>\r\n<p>Chartered Surveyor. Fellow of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers.<br />RICS registered valuer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Clive specialises in surveys of residential property and valuation, sale and letting of commerical and agricultural property. He also heads up our residential letting department. After studying estate management at London University and subsequent training positions Clive has been engaged with Thorne and Carter in both professional and agency work in Mid Devon since joining the firm in 1976. He became a partner in 1989. Clive is therefore well versed in the local property market and draws on a wealth of experience in his work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>John Parkin &nbsp; FNAEA</h4>\r\n<p>Fellow of the National Association of Estate Agents.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">John is in charge of the valuation, marketing and sale of residential property, from town cottage to country house. John comes from a background of law and subsequently trained with a large multi office firm of estate agents in Hampshire before moving to Devon in 1979 to manage the residential department of an Exeter based rural practice. John became an equity partner of Thorne and Carter in 1989 and offers an immense wealth of expertise combined with local knowledge and experience.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Location</h2>\r\n<p>Cullompton, Devon<br /><strong>A wonderful rural yet accessible location in which to live!</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The rapidly expanding country town of Cullompton enjoys an unrivalled easily accessible location close to junction 28 of the M5 which facilitates rapid commuting south to the cathedral city of Exeter (about 14 miles) and north to the country town of Taunton (22 miles). Tiverton Parkway Station lies about 6 miles to the north and provides a fast service to London (Paddington).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Cullompton offers a range of high street shops together with Tesco supermarket in addition to two primary schools and two doctors'' surgeries. Secondary schooling is provided by the Cullompton Community College and the highly regarded Uffculme Secondary School which serves a large proportion of the Culm Valley. The renowned Blundell''s public school at Tiverton is about 5 miles, whilst Exeter offers a wide range of independent schooling in addition to the recently completed Princesshay shopping mall.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Cullompton''s comparatively central Mid Devon location places the picturesque National Parks of Dartmoor and Exmoor together with the north and south Devon coastlines all within a modest car journey. The surrounding countryside offers a wealth of rural pursuits with gliding and flying being available in the nearby Blackdown Hills, an area designated as being of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>', 'Thorne + Carter - Independent Chartered Surveyors, Estate Agents, Valuers and Auctioneers based in the Culm Valley town of Cullompton, Devon, England.', 'estate agents, property, estate agents Cullompton, houses for sale, Culm Valley, Willand, Kentisbeare, Plymtree, Bradninch, Uffculme, Culmstock', '2013-12-23 11:03:31', '2013-12-03 09:46:04', 0, 1),
