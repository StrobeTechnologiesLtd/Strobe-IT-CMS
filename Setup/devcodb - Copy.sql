They are a very good garage and I get good service from them. And they are local.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>08/11/2011</div>\r\n<p>They said they would look after me and that is exactly what they did. They stuck to their promises which is rare from garages these days. There were no problems and I could not fault them at all. I would certainly recommend them.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>08/11/2011</div>\r\n<p>I have been using them for the last five years and have always been completely satisfied with the jobs done, and they have always been very helpful.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>07/11/2011</div>\r\n<p>I have been using them for over twenty years and I find them to be completely reliable.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>13/10/2011</div>\r\n<p>Everything went fine. We got a good combined MOT and service deal that Renault were offering. We were able to leave the car with them and go off into town, and they called us a few hours later to let us know the car was ready. The service was done fine and they had also done a decent clean on the car.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>10/10/2011</div>\r\n<p>The communication and reception was very good. They were helpful and let me know what was going on during the service when I was not there.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>07/10/2011</div>\r\n<p>We have been using the garage since 1980 and bought the cars from them. We have always had a good service from them and feel I have complete faith in them.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>07/10/2011</div>\r\n<p>They were customer friendly and followed up with a couple of phone calls after to make certain everything was working all right and that I was happy.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>06/10/2011</div>\r\n<p>I am totally satisfied with them, I can''t fault them. They are good, they are always very courteous and the service is excellent.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>28/09/2011</div>\r\n<p>They are an absolutely perfect family and professional business, they are very accommodating, very informative and they are first class. I purchased another Renault from them for my Son, I told them what I wanted and they searched the market and came up with the goods. They are just very good.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>20/09/2011</div>\r\n<p>The reception I receive when I go in there. The attitude when dealing with me and any problems if I have any. I am treated as a wanted customer and a needed customer. On collection I am given my vehicle back in such a state that I think, wow. I am treated marvellously. They are cheerful on the outset which makes a difference when I go in and spend money.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>05/09/2011</div>\r\n<p>They are a family run firm. We have had four cars in ten years from them. They provide a good personal service. It is cheaper to get cars serviced there than in London where I live. We go to visit friends in the area, then we use Devco as part of the trip. They are good at finding pre-used cars as they only deal in the top end cars. We have been more than pleased and never had any problems buying them. We like Renaults anyway, and feel that their reliability is very good.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>03/09/2011</div>\r\n<p>I have always found them to be very good at informing me as to when the next MOT or service is due. We fix a time, I take the car in and they offer me an estimate of the time it will take. They give me an estimate of how much it will cost. They phone me when the work is completed. I am satisfied with the work they have done. It was excellent. I cannot see how it could be made better, apart from the agony of paying. Since I had the MOT I have found that I probably could have had it done cheaper elsewhere, but that is not really a worry for me.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review</span>\r\n<div>02/09/2011</div>\r\n<p>They were excellent. Very good and very polite. Joan the service reception lady was very good, but they all are. I also dealt with Justin. They called me up to let me know that the brake discs were worn. They explained to me what the cost would be and if I wanted them to go ahead with the work. They didn''t just go ahead and do it.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>24/08/2011</div>\r\n<p>I have had my vehicle serviced there for a number of years now, they are prompt, efficient, courteous and I would not want to go anywhere else to get my vehicle serviced, as we get an honest and knowledgeable service. Otherwise I would not return year after year.</p>\r\n<div><span>Review </span>\r\n<div>20/08/2011</div>\r\n<p>Because they have a very friendly attitude, they are very positive and they keep you updated. They rang me the next day to see if everything was OK and I got home safely. I have already recommended them as my son-in-law bought a new Renault from them last year. I had a very positive attitude from them and I was impressed, I told him that they are very good people to deal with. You go in and you are made welcome by the receptionist. I said I had a problem and she said they will have a look at it but I would be charged half an hour labour charge. They did it there while I waited and she reported back. I got a chance to speak to the technician. I am just pleased and if I am fortunate enough to buy a new car I would go to Renault. It would be a second hand car. I would go back but it is quite a way away from me.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Aftersales', 'new cars,new car, Devon, Tiverton, West country, South West, new car prices,used car prices, new car price,used car price, used car values,used car classifieds, car review,car reviews, buy a car,sell a car, auto classifieds,car prices, cars for sale, autos for sale, autotrader, auto trader, used cars,used car, new cars,new car, automotive, new car prices,used car prices, new car price,used car price, used car values,used car classifieds, car review,car reviews, buy a car,sell a car, auto classifieds,car prices, cars for sale, autos for sale, new cars,new car, Devon, Tiverton, West country, South West', ''),
